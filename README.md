# Shivneri-Marathi-LLM
## Introduction
Generative AI is going to usher in several benefits for people world over and it is necessary to bring in or percolate those benefits to all the people across the world. Especially in India there is a huge percentage of people that don’t speak/write English and in order to ensure these benefits do reach non-English speaking population it is necessary to enable availability of this technology for all the Indian languages. With this in mind there are several initiatives in India that are in progress to enable Generative AI features in different Indian Languages.

Shivneri Marathi LLM is being built with the wish to bring the benefits of Generative AI to non-English (especially Marathi) speaking population of India. Marathi has the third largest number of native speakers in India, after Hindi and Bengali. Almost 83 million people speak the language. This is a preliminary version of our Marathi LLM (Large Language Model)! Built on the mighty Llama3 8B instruct model, Shivneri LLM can generate creative and informative text in both Marathi and English. This is just the beginning – we're constantly improving Shivneri, and even more exciting features are on the horizon!

Model is named as Shivneri, a place in Maharashtra India, is the birthplace of Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of Maratha Empire. It’s the place where a new beginning happened that led to prosperity of people. On the similar lines we wish to bring the benefits of Generative AI to non-English (especially Marathi) speaking population of India.

## Goal
Shivneri LLM is an Open-source initiative and is focused on building an Open source LLM to enable several different applications in Marathi and thus bring in the benefits of Generative AI to Marathi speaking population. To start with we focus on Marathi but this initiative can be extended to other Indian languages too as needed.

Most of the multi-lingual LLMs available today do have very basic support for Indian languages.
There are three key problems in the way these LLMs support Indian Languages which we plan to solve with Shivneri LLM initiative:
* High Token Count issue: Most of the available LLMs like LLAMA-2, OpenAI GPT take up too many tokens to encode a word in Indian Langauge. Almost 2-3x token count is needed for Indian language queries. High token count leads to high cost and low performance.
* Lack for Indian context in Training Data: Most of the LLMs are trained mainly in English language and data that is available on Internet. Most of the Indian languages are low-resource languages in the sense that less language based text is available on the internet. Thus data to train the models on Indian language is scarce and thus the native data specific to Indian context is missing in the training of the generally available LLMs.
* Bilingual Support with English: Most of the spoken Indian languages are mixed with English words thus it is necessary to support text or conversation that has mix of both Indian language and English words.
